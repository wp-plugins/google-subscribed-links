Once subscribed, your site will always appear first in their search results and be highlighted. This means that your site is always first and highlighted - no matter what its PageRank.
== Installation ==

1. Once activated, go to [Google Subscribed Links](http://www.google.com/coop/subscribedlinks/), and click on the *Create a Subscribed Link* button.
2. Choose *Submit the URL of a feed file*.
3. Fill in the form (**don't** tick "Only read DataObjects"); for the URL write your normal feed URL but add a `coop=1` query to the end of it. For example, `http://example.com/feed/?coop=1` or without fancy permalinks `http://example.com/?feed=rss2&coop=1`.

Once you've submitted your feed, you can then spread the word and get people to subscribe!
